// Non-Primitive data types, also known as reference data types, on the other hand, include Objects, Arrays and Functions and can hold multiple values due to their dynamic behaviour.

// Array
var arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9];
console.log(arr); 

// Object

var obj={name:"Rahul" , age:"20"}
console.log(obj);
console.log(obj.name);
console.log(obj.age);
